Privacy Policy

Advertising

Our app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.

To comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland are asked for consent before personalized ads are shown.

We use a Consent Management Platform (CMP) certified under the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) to collect and manage user consent.

Users may:

Accept personalized advertising

Reject personalized advertising

Manage or change their consent preferences at any time through the app’s privacy settings

Depending on the user’s consent choice, ads may be personalized or non-personalized.

Data Collection

Our app does not directly collect personally identifiable information.

Advertising partners, including Google, may use cookies or device identifiers to serve ads, in accordance with the user’s consent and applicable laws.

In-App Purchases

The app may offer In-App Purchases (IAP) to remove ads or unlock premium features.
If a user purchases an ad-free option, advertisements will no longer be loaded or displayed.

User Rights

Users located in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland have the right to:

Access their personal data

Withdraw consent at any time

Request deletion of their data where applicable
